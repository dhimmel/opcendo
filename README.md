# Datamining OPC and endothelial cell interactors

Daniel Himmelstein & Dan Zollinger

Identify genes enriched in OPC and endothelial cells.

[`encrichment.ipynb`](encrichment.ipynb) is a notebook which performs the analysis. The results are saved to [`data/enrichment.tsv`](data/enrichment.tsv), which is a text file that can be opened in Excel.

## Resources

RNA-seq expression data is from the [Brain RNA-Seq Database](http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html) (DOI: [10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1860-14.2014](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1860-14.2014 "An RNA-Sequencing Transcriptome and Splicing Database of Glia, Neurons, and Vascular Cells of the Cerebral Cortex")).

## Installation

_Instructions for biologists:_

If you don't already have python, install [Anaconda for Python 3.5](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Next clone this repository to your computer. You can also [download and extract a zip](https://github.com/dhimmel/opcixn/archive/master.zip).

Launch Jupyter (`jupyter notebook` in terminal or using the Anaconda GUI) and navigate to the [`encrichment.ipynb`](encrichment.ipynb) notebook.
