# Datamining OPC and endothelial cell interactors

Daniel Himmelstein & Dan Zollinger

Identify genes enriched in OPC and endothelial cells.

[`encrichment.ipynb`](encrichment.ipynb) is a notebook which performs the analysis. The results are saved to [`data/enrichment.tsv`](data/enrichment.tsv), which is a text file that can be opened in Excel.
